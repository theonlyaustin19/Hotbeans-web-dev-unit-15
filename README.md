Alternative designs : 

 Description :   This version of the home page uses a horizontal navigation bar at the bottom instead of the top, with a full-width image banner and a welcome message overlay. Instead of individual content sections, it uses a slider to show "Meet the Developers", "Apply Now", and "Courses" as rotating cards.

 Design features :

● Bottom nav bar: Home | About Us | Apply Now | Meet the Developers

● sliders can hide key info and may reduce accessibility.

● Less efficient for users who want to jump directly to the info they need.

## Why It Was Not Chosen:

● The bottom nav is less intuitive as users are more familiar with top navigation.

● Carousels can hide key info and may reduce accessibility.

● Less efficient for users who want to jump directly to the info they need.

## Technical Documentation:
 
 ##  Site Structure:

● index.html → Homepage

● about.html → About Us

● developers.html → Meet the Developers

● apply.html → Apply Now

## Tools & Technologies:

● HTML5 for page structure

● CSS3 for layout and styling

● draw.io for wireframes

● GitHub to host version-controlled files

● VS Code or similar code editor

● Responsive layout designed for desktop, tablet, and mobile


## P3 Review the website design proposals with others to identify and inform

| The navigation bar may feel cramped on smaller screens                         |I added a mobile-friendly hamburger menu for better navigation on phones and tablets          |
| Developer profiles looked too plain                                            | I included hover effects and added skill badges (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript)                 |
|    |
|      |
| Courses page appeared basic and lacked trust signals                           | I added course descriptions and included official logos for each course provider              |
