Alternative designs : 

 Description :   This version of the home page uses a horizontal navigation bar at the bottom instead of the top, with a full-width image banner and a welcome message overlay. Instead of individual content sections, it uses a slider to show "Meet the Developers", "Apply Now", and "Courses" as rotating cards.

 Design features :

Bottom nav bar: Home | About Us | Apply Now | Meet the Developers

sliders can hide key info and may reduce accessibility.

Less efficient for users who want to jump directly to the info they need.

Why It Was Not Chosen:

The bottom nav is less intuitive as users are more familiar with top navigation.

Carousels can hide key info and may reduce accessibility.

Less efficient for users who want to jump directly to the info they need.
